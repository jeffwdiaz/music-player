# What is bin?

The **bin** folder contains the compiled output of the music player application. This is where the build process places all the executable files, libraries, and dependencies needed to run the application.

## Purpose

The bin folder houses:

- **MusicPlayer.exe** - The main executable file that runs the application
- **MusicPlayer.dll** - The compiled application library
- **NAudio libraries** - Audio processing dependencies (NAudio.dll, NAudio.Core.dll, etc.)
- **TagLibSharp.dll** - Metadata reading library
- **Configuration files** - Runtime configuration and dependency information

## Key Responsibilities

- Store the final compiled application
- Include all necessary dependencies and libraries
- Provide the executable files for running the application
- Contain debug symbols and runtime configuration

## Build Process

This folder is automatically generated during the build process and contains the Debug build output. The contents are created when you build the project in Visual Studio or using the .NET CLI. The folder structure follows the .NET build conventions with subfolders for different build configurations (Debug/Release) and target frameworks.
